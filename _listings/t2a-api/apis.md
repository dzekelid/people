description: Simunix pioneered the UK&#8217;s first directory enquiries website -
  ukphonebook.com - and has been providing directory solutions to many of the UK&#8217;s
  top organisations since 1999.Simunix was established in 1998 by Managing Director,
  John Lewis and became the first non-telecom company to license the UK&#8217;s national
  directory database. In 1999, it became one of the first to set up a free online
  directory enquiries service - ukphonebook.com.Building on the popularity of ukphonebook.com,
  Corporate ukphonebook.com was created as a dedicated business service in 2000. It
  now supplies customers including Merseyside Police and Yorkshire Building Society
  with access to telephone and address information as well as the UK Electoral Roll.Further
  developments came in 2002 in response to the deregulation of voice directory enquiries
  services with the switch from the old access code to a range of competing services
  under the code 118xxx. Simunix took part in the high-profile number allocation lottery
  and chose 118080, 118365 and 118090 (for international directory enquiries). 118-Express
  was created at this time to coincide with the changes occurring in the industry
  sector.Most recent projects have included the development of TPS Manage, a TPS/CTPS
  check facility, and T2A, a powerful API for finding, validating and verifying data.Simunix
  now supplies its range of directory products and services to most private and public
  sectors including, police, banking, legal, local authorities and many more.
